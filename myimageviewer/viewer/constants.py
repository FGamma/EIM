ABOUT = """<p>The <b>Image Viewer</b> example shows how to combine QLabel
and QScrollArea to display an image. QLabel is typically used
for displaying a text, but it can also display an image.
QScrollArea provides a scrolling view around another widget.
If the child widget exceeds the size of the frame, QScrollArea
automatically provides scroll bars. </p><p>The example
demonstrates how QLabel's ability to scale its contents
(QLabel.scaledContents), and QScrollArea's ability to
automatically resize its contents
(QScrollArea.widgetResizable), can be used to implement
zooming and scaling features. </p>
